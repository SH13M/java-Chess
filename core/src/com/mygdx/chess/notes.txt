0=empty, 1=pawn, 2=bishop, 3=knight, 4=rook, 5=king, 6=queen [+]white [-]black

Ideas:
    For pinning a piece, maybe try temporarily making the square empty, then scanning if will be checked, and if so,
    get no valid moves.


LOG OF ISSUES:

        When selecting a movable piece twice, you can then select any of your other pieces and then
        move it to any of the original piece's valid squares (should be fixed now)

        The check seem to be working, but the king can still move into squares where
        he is still in check, other pieces also can't block for the king yet

        The PieceRules.java class is approaching 1000 lines which is way too long, I've decided to refactor it by
        splitting it into smaller piece classes, I'll most likely repurpose the PieceRules class by having it
        contain methods that all the piece classes can use and then renaming it

        Refactoring has begun (I really hope this will not take forever)

        OKAY I HAVE MANAGED TO SPLIT THE THINGS INTO SEPARATE CLASSES WITHOUT BREAKING THE ENTIRE PROGRAM

        King can sometimes move into squares that bishop has vision of (fixed)

        My idea for pinning pieces only works partially. The issue is currently the way it checks for pins is
        temporarily setting the position of the piece false and then checks for attacks on the king. This approach
        does not take into consideration of the cases where pieces move and still blocks the king from check.
        I probably will need to use ScanForCheck method instead of ScanForPseudoCheck method to fix.

        Pinning should fully work now.

        king can't move top right rn (omg fixed it was 1 line what was messed up)

Reflection:
    The project was finished on 06/03/2021. This is my first time creating any type of game or using a framework so I'm
    pretty proud of what I've accomplished. I've learned many things while working on this project and I have much more
    to learn. One thing I can definitely improve is the structure and organization of my code. The methods and classes
    in this project seem to be all around the place with no actual organization, and I'm pretty sure I'm doing some bad
    code practice. Next time I might try starting off with an algorithm or pseudocode to structure my program better.
